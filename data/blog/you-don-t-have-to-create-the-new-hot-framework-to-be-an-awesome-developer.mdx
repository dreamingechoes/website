There's a lot written about this topic, and I’m probably not going to say anything new. This is more of a reminder for myself—something to look back on and feel "better" about my choices.

Let’s be honest: we have a problem in the tech industry. Well, we have a lot of problems, but one of the most harmful to our health (both physical and mental) is what I call the **Rockstar Syndrome**. We feel the need to be the best developer in the world, attend every single conference, maintain a **GitHub** profile filled with 10K+ starred repositories... but not everyone can handle that pressure.

Many of us understand that these things aren’t requirements to be a good developer. However, the industry often glorifies these profiles, creating an unhealthy culture that sidelines those who don’t fit the mold.

After years in the industry, having experienced both sides, I want to leave a few reminders for those who feel pressured to be the next **Rockstar**:

- **Your time is yours.** No one should dictate what you do after work.
- **Learn if you want to.** If you're excited about a new technology, dive into it.
- **Don’t feel pressured.** If you prefer to disconnect from software development after work, that's completely fine.
- **Live a balanced life.** Spend time on what makes you happy, exercise, and clear your mind.
- **Share experiences.** Learning from others and sharing knowledge benefits everyone.
- **Make an impact in your own way.** Contribute to non-profit organizations, support diversity in tech, and help underrepresented groups. **Software development isn’t just about code—it’s about people.**

And most importantly, remember this: **You can become an amazing developer if your company supports your growth during working hours.** Don't let industry pressure take away your life. **Be happy.**

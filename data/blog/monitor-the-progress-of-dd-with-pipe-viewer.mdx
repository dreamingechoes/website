summary: Learn how to use Pipe Viewer (pv) to monitor the progress of burning images to microSD cards for Raspberry Pi.

As a **Raspberry Pi** fan, I frequently burn different images onto multiple microSD cards to test new distros. The process can be frustrating due to the lack of feedback while writing the image. Thatâ€™s why I started looking for a solutionâ€”and I found **Pipe Viewer (pv)**.

## What is Pipe Viewer?

[Pipe Viewer](https://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml) is a terminal-based tool that allows you to monitor the progress of data through a pipeline. This is particularly useful when writing large images to microSD cards.

### Installing Pipe Viewer

If you're on **macOS**, install it using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install pv
```

For **Linux**, check your package manager. On Debian-based systems:

```sh
sudo apt install pv
```

## Burning an Image to a microSD Card with Progress Monitoring

Once your microSD card is inserted and the image is downloaded, use the following command to burn the image while getting real-time progress updates:

```sh
dd if=/path/to/2017-04-10-raspbian-jessie.img | pv | dd of=/dev/your_disk
```

Instead of waiting blindly, **pv** will provide feedback like this:

```sh
87.3MiB 0:07:24 [ 178KiB/s] [ <=>								]
```

Now you have a simple way to track the progress of image burning! ðŸ˜ƒ

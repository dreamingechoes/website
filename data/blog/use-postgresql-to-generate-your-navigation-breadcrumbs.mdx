While reading the **PostgreSQL** documentation, I found the [WITH queries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/queries-with.html) quite interesting. I decided to use them for a common scenario: generating breadcrumbs for the navigation of a storage system.

Instead of making a database request for each element inside the folder tree, we can use a single query to generate the breadcrumb elements efficiently.

## The Folder Relationship

Letâ€™s assume we have the classic relationship between a folder and its parent. We can retrieve the breadcrumb elements using a recursive **WITH query**. Since I primarily work with **Elixir**, hereâ€™s how the query looks in **Elixir**:

```elixir
def get_breadcrumb_elements(folder_id) do
  query = """
    WITH RECURSIVE aux AS (
      SELECT id, name, parent_id
      FROM folders
      WHERE id = #{folder_id}
    UNION ALL
      SELECT c.id, c.name, c.parent_id
      FROM aux x, folders c
      WHERE x.parent_id = c.id AND c.parent_id IS NOT NULL
    )
    SELECT id, name FROM aux r ORDER BY id
  """

  case SQL.query(Repo, query, []) do
    {:ok, result} -> result.rows
    {:error, _} -> []
  end
end
```

## Generating Breadcrumbs in HTML

Once we retrieve the breadcrumb elements, we can generate the **HTML** for breadcrumbs like this:

```elixir
def breadcrumbs(folder_id) do
  folder_id
  |> get_breadcrumb_elements()
  |> Enum.map(fn [_, id, name] ->
    link(name, to: whatever_route_path(YourApp.Endpoint, :show, id))
  end)
end
```

And there you have it! Your new, optimized breadcrumbs powered by **PostgreSQL WITH queries**. ðŸ˜ƒ

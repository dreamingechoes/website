When attempting to install version `0.10.2` of the `therubyracer` gem on Mac OS X Yosemite, I ran into some issues. After trying various solutions, I found one that worked reliably for me.

Here’s the step-by-step process that solved the problem:

```sh
brew tap homebrew/dupes
brew install apple-gcc42

export CC=/usr/local/Cellar/apple-gcc42/4.2.1-5666.3/bin/gcc-4.2
export CXX=/usr/local/Cellar/apple-gcc42/4.2.1-5666.3/bin/g++-4.2
export CPP=/usr/local/Cellar/apple-gcc42/4.2.1-5666.3/bin/cpp-4.2

brew uninstall v8
gem uninstall libv8
gem install therubyracer -v '0.10.2'
```

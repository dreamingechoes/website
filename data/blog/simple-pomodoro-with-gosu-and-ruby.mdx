The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervalsâ€”traditionally 25 minutesâ€”separated by short breaks. These intervals are called _pomodoros_ (from the Italian word for tomato). The method aims to improve focus and productivity through frequent breaks. _(Wikipedia)_

This is a simple Pomodoro timer with a minimal graphical interface, built in **Ruby** using **Gosu** for fun.

## Installation

Since this gem uses **Gosu** to launch the graphical interface, youâ€™ll need to install Gosu dependencies first.

### Mac OS X

Gosu is built on top of **SDL 2**. Install **Homebrew** and run:

```sh
brew install sdl2
```

### Linux

Youâ€™ll need to install the following packages (names may vary by distribution):

- `libsdl2-dev`
- `libsdl2-ttf-dev`
- `libpango1.0-dev`
- `libgl1-mesa-dev`
- `libfreeimage-dev`
- `libopenal-dev`
- `libsndfile-dev`

For more details, check [Gosu's Wiki](https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki).

### Installing the Gem

Once dependencies are installed, you can install the gem:

```sh
gem install pomodoro-gui
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can view available options by running:

```sh
pomodoro-gui -h
```

Example output:

```sh
Usage: pomodoro-gui [options]
    -r, --rest [REST]                Choose rest time (in minutes)
    -i, --interval [INTERVAL]        Choose pomodoro length time (in minutes)
        --version                    Show version
    -h, --help                       Show this message
```

To start a Pomodoro session with default values (25-minute work sessions, 5-minute breaks), simply run:

```sh
pomodoro-gui
```

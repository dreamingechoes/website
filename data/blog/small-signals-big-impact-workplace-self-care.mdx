When we think about workplace self-care, our minds often jump to big initiatives—mental health days, wellness stipends, and company-wide mindfulness programs. While these are valuable, they’re not the only way to foster a culture of well-being. Sometimes, the most impactful changes come from small, thoughtful actions that help us support one another in everyday moments.

Recently, I experimented with one such small idea: **creating tiny Slack emojis to help people indicate when they’re not feeling 100%**. The concept was inspired by [Social Battery Pins](https://www.ateliereumori.com/products/the-original-social-battery-interactive-enamel-pin)—those little badges people wear to signal their energy levels subtly. In theory, a simple emoji on a Slack status could provide a quick, non-intrusive way for coworkers to communicate how they’re feeling without having to explain.

But here’s what I learned: **emojis don’t handle details well** (or maybe my Figma skills just weren’t up to the task 😅). Instead, I ended up creating a set of shareable images—something more visible and clear—so that anyone could quickly let their team know where their energy level is at.

## Why This Matters

We all have days when we feel drained, overwhelmed, or not in the mood for intense collaboration. But in many workplaces, there’s an unspoken expectation to always be “on.” In fast-paced environments, the pressure to maintain high energy, contribute enthusiastically, and engage in meetings can be exhausting—especially when we’re struggling internally.

When people don’t have an easy way to communicate how they’re feeling, they may resort to **masking their emotions, avoiding interactions, or pushing through exhaustion**, leading to burnout. **But what if we made it easier to signal when we need space, without stigma or fear of judgment?**

A simple Slack status, a shared visual, or a small indicator can make a difference in helping teams be more mindful of each other’s well-being. It creates space for self-awareness, mutual respect, and a more human-centered approach to work.

## The Power of Small Actions

Supporting workplace well-being **doesn’t have to be complicated or policy-driven**. Sometimes, it’s as simple as:

- **Checking in on a teammate** who seems quieter than usual.
- **Encouraging breaks, not just meetings**, and respecting when someone needs to step away.
- **Normalizing non-verbal communication**—whether it’s a Slack status, an emoji, or an image—to let people express their mental state without forcing conversation.
- **Giving permission (and leading by example) to take mental rest**—whether it’s a walk, a quiet afternoon, or a work-from-home recharge day.

When we create an environment where people feel **safe to acknowledge their energy levels**, we enable healthier, more sustainable workplaces. Work isn’t just about productivity—it’s about people.

## A Culture of Care Starts with Us

We don’t need permission from leadership to start making small changes that improve our daily work experiences. By being **more intentional about how we support each other**, we can create a culture where well-being is valued just as much as deadlines.

So, the next time you feel like you’re running on empty, consider signaling it—whether through a Slack status, an emoji, or just letting a teammate know. **And if you see someone else signaling? Respect it. Support them. Normalize it.**

Let’s build workplaces where it’s okay not to be at 100% all the time.

**Take care of yourself—your well-being matters more than any deadline.**

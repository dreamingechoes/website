Last year, I went through a **mental breakdown**. Life changes, social anxiety, and juggling too many projects led me into depression and anxiety. This is normalâ€”**it isn't something to be ashamed of**. Everyone faces challenges, and the key is **knowing how to tackle them**.

## Acknowledging the Issue

Months ago, I decided to take control, become aware of my struggles, and try to understand the causes to address them. Besides seeking professional help (**always start with professional advice**), I searched for others who had shared their experiences with mental health.

A big factor in my **mental breakdown** was the **software industry** itself. We all know that it can be **toxic**â€”you're expected to constantly stay ahead, have multiple side projects, maintain a fully green **GitHub** profile, send **C4P** submissions for conferences, and strive to be the **_next IT influencer_**. **It's too much pressure.**

I love learning, working on side projects, and sharing knowledge, but when the industry demands that you **compromise your own health** just to stay relevant, that's when problems start to escalate.

## Raising Awareness

Through my search, I realized that **mental health doesnâ€™t get enough visibility** in tech. This is a problem we need to change. **Mental health** and **neurodiversity** are real issuesâ€”we must combat the **stigma** and **discrimination** surrounding them.

Hearing others' experiences helped me immensely. Along the way, I created a list of mental health resources for people in the software industry, collecting and sharing what helped me. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/dreamingechoes/awesome-mental-health).

If you're looking for a starting point, I recommend this **James Meickle** talk about **mental health and neurodiversity in engineering**:

Please share these resources with those who may need them. Support organizations like [OSMI](https://osmihelp.org/) and [Compassionate Coding](https://compassionatecoding.com/), attend conferences like [Anxiety Tech](http://www.anxietytech.com/), and **share your own story**.

## Daily Habits That Help

Besides learning from these resources, Iâ€™ve adopted simple daily habits that help my recovery. These may help you too:

- **Eat well and exercise regularly:** Physical health directly impacts mental well-being.
- **Celebrate small wins:** Acknowledge everyday achievements, like fixing a bug or completing a small feature.
- **Be kind to others:** Helping and supporting people makes you feel happier.
- **Rest properly:** Prioritize good sleep and distance yourself from stress-inducing activities.
- **Stay hydrated:** Seriously, drink water!

Start **taking care of yourself**â€”no side project, software conference, or company is more important than **your mental health**. ðŸ’™

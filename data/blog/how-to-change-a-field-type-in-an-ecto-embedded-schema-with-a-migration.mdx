## Why I’m Writing This?

The other day, I had to change the type of a field in an **Ecto embedded schema** from a string to a list of strings. Sounds simple, right? Well, not quite—because this field already had existing data stored in **PostgreSQL** as JSONB. That meant I had to not only update my **Elixir codebase** but also write a migration to transform the stored data correctly.

Since this is a challenge others will likely encounter, I wanted to document the process, including the reasoning behind each step. If you ever need to change a field type in an embedded schema, this guide will help you do it safely without breaking your existing data.

## Understanding the Challenge

Ecto **embedded schemas** ([Ecto.Schema docs](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html)) are different from standard schemas because they are stored inside JSONB columns rather than as separate database tables. This makes migrations trickier—there’s no direct `ALTER COLUMN` statement we can run to change the field type.

In my case, the field in question was `tags`, originally defined as a string:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Schema do
  use Ecto.Schema

  embedded_schema do
    field :tags, :string
  end
end
```

However, I wanted `tags` to be a **list of strings** instead of a single string. The updated schema looks like this:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Schema do
  use Ecto.Schema

  embedded_schema do
    field :tags, {:array, :string}
  end
end
```

The key change here is using `{:array, :string}` as the field type, which tells Ecto to expect a list of strings instead of a single string. You can read more about supported field types in the [Ecto Types documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html#module-field-types).

But making this change alone is **not enough**—existing records in the database still have `tags` stored as plain strings, so we need a migration to transform that data.

## Writing the Migration to Update Existing Data

Since **embedded schemas are stored as JSONB** in PostgreSQL, we must update the values properly using JSONB functions.

First, generate the migration:

```sh
mix ecto.gen.migration update_tags_field
```

Then, open the generated migration file and implement the logic to transform the field.

### **Migration Code:**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.UpdateTagsField do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def up do
    execute("""
    UPDATE my_table
    SET embedded_schema_field = jsonb_set(
      embedded_schema_field,
      '{tags}',
      to_jsonb(string_to_array((embedded_schema_field->>'tags'), ','))
    )
    WHERE embedded_schema_field ? 'tags';
    """)
  end

  def down do
    execute("""
    UPDATE my_table
    SET embedded_schema_field = jsonb_set(
      embedded_schema_field,
      '{tags}',
      to_jsonb(array_to_string((embedded_schema_field->'tags')::text[], ','))
    )
    WHERE embedded_schema_field ? 'tags';
    """)
  end
end
```

### **Breaking Down the SQL:**

- `string_to_array((embedded_schema_field->>'tags'), ',')`:
  - Converts the existing string into an array, splitting by commas.
- `to_jsonb(...)`:
  - Ensures the updated value remains in **JSONB format**.
- `jsonb_set(...)`:
  - Updates only the `tags` key inside the embedded schema field.
- `WHERE embedded_schema_field ? 'tags'`:
  - Ensures we only update records that contain the `tags` field.

For the **rollback (`down/0`)**, we reverse the process by **converting the array back into a comma-separated string**.

If you're unfamiliar with these PostgreSQL functions, you can check out the official [PostgreSQL JSONB functions documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html) for more details.

Additionally, the PostgreSQL JSONB data type is quite powerful, and you can learn more about its capabilities in the [JSON Types documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html).

## Running and Verifying the Migration

Once the migration is in place, apply it:

```sh
mix ecto.migrate
```

Then, verify the results by querying the database:

```sql
SELECT embedded_schema_field FROM my_table WHERE embedded_schema_field ? 'tags';
```

Check that `tags` is now stored as an **array** rather than a plain string.

Additionally, if you have any **existing Ecto queries** that previously treated `tags` as a string, you’ll need to update them to work with lists instead. Learn more about working with array fields in queries in the [Ecto Query documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Query.html).

## Conclusion

- **Embedded schemas store data as JSONB, requiring special handling when changing field types.**
- **Schema updates alone are not enough**—we must also migrate existing data correctly.
- **PostgreSQL’s `jsonb_set()` function** is a powerful way to update JSONB fields safely.
- This approach ensures a smooth transition without losing or corrupting data.

If you’ve run into similar challenges with Ecto and JSONB migrations, I’d love to hear how you tackled them!

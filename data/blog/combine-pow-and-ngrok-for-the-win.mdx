If you need to share the progress of your web application with others or put it online quickly without setting up a server, **Ngrok** can be a great solution.

Last weekend, I had to demo a **Rails** app I was developing, but I didnâ€™t have time to create a new online server and deploy it. Instead, I used **Ngrok**, a magical service a coworker introduced me to.

## What is Ngrok?

**Ngrok** provides a simple way to expose local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet via secure tunnels. In just a few seconds, your web app can be accessible online.

### Setting Up Ngrok

1. **Create an account** on [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) to get a tunnel authtoken.
2. **Download the Ngrok binary** from the official website.
3. **Configure your authtoken**:

```sh
./ngrok authtoken YOUR_TUNNEL_AUTHTOKEN
```

### Starting a Secure Tunnel

To expose your local web application, run:

```sh
./ngrok http 80
```

Ngrok will generate an external **URL** (e.g., `abcdefg.ngrok.io`) where your application will be accessible.

To monitor traffic passing through the tunnel, visit:

```sh
http://localhost:4040
```

To stop the tunnel, simply press `Ctrl+C`.

## What is Pow?

**Pow** is a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X, making it easy to manage Rails apps locally. If youâ€™re on Linux, you can use an alternative like [Prax](http://ysbaddaden.github.io/prax).

### Installing Pow

To install **Pow**, run:

```sh
curl get.pow.cx | sh
```

Then, set up a Rack app by creating a symlink in `~/.pow`:

```sh
cd ~/.pow
ln -s /path/to/some/railsapp
```

Your app will now be available at:

```sh
http://railsapp.dev/
```

## Using Ngrok with Pow

If you have your **Rails** app running with **Pow**, you can make it publicly accessible using **Ngrok** by running:

```sh
./ngrok http -host-header=railsapp.dev railsapp.dev:80
```

And thatâ€™s it! Now your local **Rails** app is online for sharing and testing. ðŸ˜ƒ

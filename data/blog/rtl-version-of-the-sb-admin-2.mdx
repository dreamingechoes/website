Some time ago, I developed a **Rails** gem to easily integrate the [SB Admin 2](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/) Bootstrap-based admin theme into applications. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/dreamingechoes/bootstrap_sb_admin_base_v2).

Originally created by **Start Bootstrap**, all credits for the Bootstrap admin theme development go to them. The original repository for the theme can be found [here](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-sb-admin-2).

## Why an RTL Version?

Recently, a user reported an issue, asking whether the gem supported an **RTL** (Right-To-Left) version of the theme. While an RTL version of **SB Admin 2** already existed, I noticed occasional bugs in its implementation. To ensure full functionality, I decided to create my own **RTL** adaptation.

Iâ€™ve now uploaded this **RTL** version to GitHub so that anyone who needs it can easily download and use it.

## Where Can I Find the Code?

You can find the complete **RTL** adaptation on [GitHub](https://github.com/dreamingechoes/sb-admin2-rtl). Feel free to clone, modify, and experiment with it! ðŸ˜ƒ

Software Engineer from the north of Spain interested in all kinds of technologies. I've been working as a software engineer since 2005, starting to develop desktop applications to quickly focus on my true passion: web development.

With years of experience working with Ruby, Rails, Elixir, and Phoenix Framework, right now I'm focused on my transition to become a T-Shaped developer: keep making my backend expertise strong while I improve my knowledge of other areas such as frontend, devops, mobile dev, and UI/UX. Working full-remote.

Diversity in the tech industry is very important to me, as well as mental health awareness, and accessibility. Always trying to do my best.

When I'm not working, I like to learn new technologies, write about software development, organize meetups and conferences about software development, mentor new developers, take some photographs, and play the guitar.

Some of my main technical skills are Elixir, Phoenix Framework, Ruby, Ruby On Rails, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, React Native, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Docker, AWS, Git, C++, and Java.

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi folks

I'm IvÃ¡n (he/him/his), pronounced [ee-bahn](https://www.spanishdict.com/pronunciation/iv%C3%A1n). Iâ€™m a **Senior Software Engineer** and **Engineering Lead** with a passion for building impactful digital products and mentoring engineers. Over the past 15+ years, Iâ€™ve specialized in backend development while also diving into frontend, DevOps, mobile, and UI/UX to deliver holistic, product-oriented solutions.

These days I lead distributed teams, shape engineering strategy, and refine system architectures. I also mentor on [MentorCruise](https://mentorcruise.com/), helping engineers grow in software development, leadership, and career progression. In the community, I founded [Elixir Asturias](https://elixirasturias.github.io/), co-organize [FabadaConf](https://fabadaconf.com/), and frequently speak about diversity, equity, inclusion, and mental health in tech, causes I advocate for through mentoring, talks, and ongoing engagement.

Outside of code, youâ€™ll likely find me playing guitar or behind a camera, and I regularly share knowledge at conferences, meetups, and other tech events.

If youâ€™d like to connect, email me at [hi@dreamingecho.es](mailto:hi@dreamingecho.es), find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ivan-gonzalez-saiz), or book a mentorship session with me on [MentorCruise](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/ivngonzlezsiz/).

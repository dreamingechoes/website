# 👋 Hi folks

I'm Iván (he/him/his), pronounced [ee-bahn](https://www.spanishdict.com/pronunciation/iv%C3%A1n). I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** and **Engineering Lead** passionate about building impactful digital products and mentoring engineers. Over the past 15+ years, I’ve focused mostly on backend work, while also going deep on frontend, DevOps, mobile, and UI/UX when it helped ship better, more product-shaped solutions.

These days I lead distributed teams, shape engineering strategy, and work on system architecture. On the side, I’m building [Avenida](https://avenida.so) — a passion project with former colleagues I genuinely love working with, on a product I truly believe in. I’ve also been distilling years of experience into my [Engineering Leadership Playbook](https://dreamingecho.es/playbook/): a practical, always-evolving operating system for healthy, high-performing engineering teams. It’s where I capture how I think about team operations, growth, delivery, and culture — with templates and patterns meant to be used, not just filed away.

I also mentor on [MentorCruise](https://mentorcruise.com/), helping engineers grow in software development, leadership, and career progression. In the community, I founded [Elixir Asturias](https://elixirasturias.github.io/), co-organize [FabadaConf](https://fabadaconf.com/), and speak regularly about diversity, equity, inclusion, and mental health in tech — causes I support through mentoring, talks, and ongoing community work.

Outside of code, you’ll likely find me playing guitar or behind a camera. I also love sharing what I learn at conferences, meetups, and other tech events.

Want to chat? Drop me an [email](mailto:hi@dreamingecho.es), connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ivan-gonzalez-saiz), or book a [mentorship session](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/ivngonzlezsiz/) — I'd love to hear from you.

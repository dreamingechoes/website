👋 Hi folks! I'm Iván, a seasoned software engineer passionate about building outstanding digital solutions. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and 15 years of professional experience.

🙋 I've got a T-shaped profile. While my core specialization lies in Backend development, I've also delved into several other exciting domains, including Frontend, DevOps, Mobile Development, and UI/UX. I love taking on complex challenges and creating product-oriented solutions that make a real impact.

🧑‍💻 Being a team player is in my DNA, and I've been leading excellent teams since 2020. I'm all about empowering fellow engineers, nurturing their growth, and creating a healthy and supportive work environment. Remote work has been my thing since 2016, and I thrive on delivering excellence in every project.

🧰 My technical toolbox is quite diverse, and I'm proficient in various technologies, such as Elixir, Phoenix Framework, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and React Native.

✨ Beyond coding, I actively promote diversity in the tech industry and advocate for mental health and accessibility awareness. These topics are close to my heart, and I believe they're essential for creating a more inclusive and supportive community.

🧘 Outside of work, I'm a perpetual learner of emerging technologies. Organizing meetups and conferences allows me to connect with like-minded professionals, and I find fulfillment in mentoring aspiring developers. You can see me capturing moments through photography or strumming on my guitar.
